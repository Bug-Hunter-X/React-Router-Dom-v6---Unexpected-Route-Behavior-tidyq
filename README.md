# React Router Dom v6 - Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using React Router Dom v6.  A specific route fails to render the intended component, even with a correct URL. This issue is isolated to a specific route and does not affect other routes within the same application.

## Problem
The route defined with `path="/contact"`, despite being correctly structured, does not render the `Contact` component. Other routes, such as `/` and `/about`, function without issue.

## Solution
The solution often lies in ensuring there are no conflicts with other routes, especially those with more general path definitions, typos in the route path, or issues with the component being rendered.
